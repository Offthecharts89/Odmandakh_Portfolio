# [Converting Casual Riders to Members Riders: Chicago Bike Data](https://github.com/Offthecharts89/Chicago-Bike-Data-Project)

### Summary
* Working with dataset with 100 million datapoints.  
* Tasked by the marketing team of Cyclistic to do an exploratory analysis of their user’s bike data. 
* Giving recommendation from my analysis of how Cyclistic can convert their casual users to full members to increase revenue, as it was previously concluded by Cyclist’s finance team that member riders are the bulk of their revenue and that they should increase the number of member riders.
* My analysis was that casual riders value fun, warm weather and the weekends. Casual riders go on longer rides on average and median. While members are more consistent. Going to work, they use it as a mode of transportation. 
* I advised the marketing team to create a weekend and summer deal. We can have them as bi-annual members or weekend member. This will create a sales funnel for casual riders to eventually become full members. 
* I gave further recommendations to market the warm weather and having fun, as casual riders value these metrics the most, using social media, their own built in app and on their bikes.

## Top Three Recommendations

* Create a weekend and bi-annual members package for casual riders to use. This will affectively make them half members.
* Market their riders for fun and warm weather. Casual riders seem to value these metrics the most.
* Use social media, their own built in app and their bikes to promote the deal.
